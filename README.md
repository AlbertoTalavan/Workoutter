I usually work out and **I was certainly  tired of writing my own workouts (routines, weights...)
on multiple notes ...** and thatÂ´s why I made my own workout tracker app, "Workoutter", just to  
keep them handy and organised in just one place.

With **Workoutter** you can **write your own workouts in an easy way and take them always with you.** 
Imagine that for any reason some day you need to go to a different training place than your usual one...  Workoutter **keeps all your routines, exercises and weights**, so you will have them always **just in your pocket!**.

The app allows you to **write whatever the workout you wanna do** (because there are not predefined exercises names 
nor routines),even tracking  the weights you use on the previous training sessions (and that's useful for your progression).  
You will write your routines the way that make more sense to you.

If you are not into make your own ones, you can transcribe the routines that you have on "paper" to the app, with the leverage of **keep them all always handy**.

Workoutter is my very own vision of how to organise my workouts, but you will soon realise that it is super **easy  
to create your routines  and/or modifying them**.

But if you have a different way of do it, do not hesitate to contact me because I am always open to suggestions.

***Hope you enjoy the app!. And if you do, please leave a comment (I do appreciate it and it is really helpful).***
