# Workoutter: Take your workouts with you


## Description
# Description
I usually work out and I was certainly  tired of writing my own workouts (routines, weights...) on multiple notes ... 
so I made my own workout tracker app, "Workoutter",  just to keep them handy and organised in just one place.

With Workoutter you can write your own workouts in an easy way and take them always with you... Imagine that for any 
reason some day you need to go to a different training place than your usual one...  Workoutter allows you to be 
independent because your have all your routines, exercises, weights... just in your pocket!.

 The app allows you to write whatever the workout you wanna do (because there are not predefined exercises names 
 nor routines),even tracking  the weights you use on the previous training sessions (and that's useful for your progression).
 You will write your routines on the way that make more sense to you and that's great because sometimes the same exercise 
 has several different names (depending on different trainers or PT).

If you are not into make your own ones, you can transcribe the routines that you have on "paper" at your gym 
just to the app, with the leverage of keep them all always handy.

Workoutter is my very own vision of how to organise my workouts,  but you will soon realise that it is super easy
to create your routines  and/or modifying them.
